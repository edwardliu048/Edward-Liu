# Who am I
My name is Edward Liu (or 刘国浩, not a translation).
I am currently an undergraduate electrical engineering student at Ryerson University in my second year of studies.

# What is the purpose of this page

The purpose of this page is to document my journey in becoming a professional electrical engineer in Ontario.

# Outside of academia

Yes, I have interests outside of engineering!

I am a hobbyist cyclist and also a runner.

Current bike: [2013 Trek 7.5 FX](https://archive.trekbikes.com/us/en/2013/Trek/7_5_fx#/us/en/2013/Trek/7_5_fx/details) - modified with Shimano 105 front and rear derailleurs 

Also very passionate about cars - specifically older Volvo wagons (P2 and older) and BMW's (E46 and older).

Hobbyist mechanic - wrench everyday (at least I try to!)
