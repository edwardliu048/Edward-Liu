# Who am I
My name is Edward Liu (or 刘国浩, not a romanization).
I am currently an undergraduate electrical engineering student at Ryerson University in my second year of studies.

# Why did I make this website

Writing is the deepest form of thinking and is one of the primary factors that has distinguised humans from other species. The website was intended to be an outlet for my ideas and experiences.

# Outside of academia

Yes, I have interests outside of engineering!

I am a hobbyist cyclist and also a runner.

Current bike: [2013 Trek 7.5 FX](https://archive.trekbikes.com/us/en/2013/Trek/7_5_fx#/us/en/2013/Trek/7_5_fx/details) - modified with Shimano 105 front and rear derailleurs 

I am very passionate about anything automotive related - which is my primary reason for joining Formula Ryerson.
My favourite cars of all time would be the P2 Volvo V70R and the E46 BMW M3.

Hobbyist mechanic - wrench everyday (at least I try to!)
