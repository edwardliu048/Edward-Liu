Inductive Spiking: a simple explaination

This isn't really a project, but the concept of inductive spiking had been confusing to me prior to drawing out this diagram.

Inductive spiking can be both desirable and undesirable. It is undesirable with a inductive load such as a motor because it can cause HUGE voltage spikes (destroying sensitive electronic conponents) and thus is normally prevented with a flyback diode. It is desirable with boost converters, and other types of non-linear regulators which take advantage of such voltage spike to create a higher stable output voltage.
