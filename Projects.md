##  Fall 2018

### [Coming soon] Modernized iMac G4 17"
The process of restoring and fully upgrading the iconic sunflower iMac (circa 2002) to modern specification will be documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zV3Tc-up3YJ_WKRi_lHMN_xX-1I49sAXWsNl3AjZHLQ/edit?usp=sharing).

Should be a fun project!

###  Inductive Spiking: a simple explaination

This isn't a project, but simply an explaination for a concept that some may have previously found confusing.

Inductive spiking can be both desirable and VERY undesirable.

It is undesirable with a inductive load such as a motor because it can cause HUGE voltage spikes (destroying sensitive electronic conponents) and thus is normally prevented with a flyback diode. 

It is desirable with boost converters, and other types of non-linear regulators which take advantage of such voltage spike to create a higher stable output voltage.
